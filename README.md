# Airbnb_dashboard

Final project for CS 5304 Data Science in the Wild at Cornell Tech.

## What is this

As the gig economy expands, Property Managers seek new ways to intelligently manage
their portfolio of Airbnb properties and hosts. This paper details the exploration of a dataset
containing historical Airbnb price, location, and reviews in New York City to develop an
intelligent dashboard for Property Managers to increase their profitability. By using
Tableau, we developed geographical heat maps and trend visualizations to highlight areas
of market dearth or saturation within the residential gig space in New York City.
